# Cryptostore sample config file

# Redis or Kafka are required. They are used to batch updates from cryptofeed and the storage medium of choice
#
# del_after_read: (redis only) toggles the removal of data from redis after it has been processed with cryptostore.
# start_flush: toggles if redis/kafka should be flushed at the start. Primarily for debugging, it will flush ALL of redis/kafka
cache: redis

kafka:
    # ip/port are for the bootstrap server
    ip: '127.0.0.1'
    port: 9092
    start_flush: true

# Data sources and data types configured under exchanges. Exchange names follow the naming scheme in cryptofeed (they
# must be capitalized) and only exchanges supported by cryptofeed are supported.
# data types follow cryptofeed definitions, see defines.py in cryptofeed for more details, common ones are
# trades, l2_book, l3_book, funding, ticker (only trades, l2_book, l3_book currently supported by cryptostore).
# Trading pairs for all exchanges (except BitMEX) follow the currency-quote format
exchanges:
    BITMEX:
        l2_book: [XBTUSD]
    COINBASE:
        l2_book: [BTC-USD]
        trades: [BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ETH-BTC]
